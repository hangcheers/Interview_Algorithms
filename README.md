# Data Structure and Machine Learning Algorithms

### Math (prior knowledge)

I reviewed the linear algbera and probability theroy.

### Data Structure  

A data structure is a container that stores data in a specific layout. This layout allows a data structure to be efficient in some operations. The goal is to understand data structure so that I can pick up the data structure that's most optimal for the problem in hand.  

Here are the mostly commonly used data structures: 
   1. arrays
   2. stacks
   3. queues
   4. linked list
   5. trees
   6. graphs
   7. tier trees
   8. hash tables


### Machine learning algorithms

Here are the mostly common used algorithms:
  1. Principal Component Analysis
  2. LDA  
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Naive Bayes classification
  3. Support Vector Machines
  4. Decision Tree and Random Forest
